		<span style="font-size:28px;">Instructions:</span><br><br>
		1. Download <span style="color: rgb(170, 6, 6)">AND RUN</span> the Java installer, unless you already have it, using <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">this link</a><br><br>
		2. Download <span style="color: rgb(170, 6, 6)">AND RUN</span> Mozila Firefox installer, unless you already have it, using <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/thanks/" target="_blank">this link</a><br><br>
		3. Download the correct Gimkit cheat using the links above<br><br>
		4. Unzip the downloaded folder and go to the new one created. You <span style="color: rgb(170, 6, 6)">MUST</span> use the unzipped version for the program to work properly<br><br>
		5. Once inside the the new folder, go through folders until you see a file called "click this to run the program.bat" and double click it<br><br>
		
		<span style="font-size:28px;">How it works:</span><br><br>
		In the program, there is a text area you can put a link. You can either use the link already there and join a standard game, or you can put in the link to an asignment.<br><br>
		When you have the link you want and you hit the go button, a Firefox window will appear.<br><br>
		Use the window as you normally would, and when you happen to be on a gimkit question, the program will answer.<br><br>
		The program has to learn the answers to questions, so it will probably get a question wrong the first time it sees it. Don't worry though, because it will save the answers of questions it sees and get it right the next time, even if it was a long time ago.<br><br>
		Still, if you are playing a game with only 30 or so terms that the program does not know, it should learn them quickly.<br><br>
		
		<span style="font-size:28px; color:rgb(170, 6, 6);">IMPORTANT:</span><br><br>
		Do not x out the Firefox Window. The tab will close when you x out the program.<br><br>
		Make sure you close the program by x-ing it out. Don't alt-f4 it because it will not close properly.<br><br>
		If you see this, please share this website/program with as many people as you can. I am curious to see how far this gets.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><!--yeah ik this looks fucking stupid but im lazy-->
