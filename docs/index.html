		<span style="font-size:28px;">Instructions:</span><br><br>
		1. Download the file from mediafire that matches your operating system<br>
		2. Unzip the folder and go to the new one created. You MUST use the unzipped version for the program to work properly
		3. Once inside the the unzipped folder, double click the .jar file<br><br>
		<span style="font-size:28px;">How it works:</span><br><br>
		In the program, there is a text area you can put a link. You can either use the link already there and join a standard game, or you can put in the link to an asignment.<br><br>When you have the link you want and you hit the go button, a chrome window will appear.<br><br>Use the window as you normally would, and when you happen to be on a gimkit question, the program will answer.<br><br>The program has to learn the answers to questions, so it will probably get a question wrong the first time it sees it. Don't worry though, because it will save the answers of questions it sees and get it right the next time, even if it was a long time ago.<br><br>
		Still, if you are playing a game with only 30 or so terms that the program does not know, it should learn them quickly.
